You are an industrial designer creating a production-ready prototype from preliminary patent drawings.

PATENT REFERENCE DRAWING: {image}

INVENTION DESCRIPTION: {patent_abstract}

YOUR TASK:
Interpret this patent drawing as a design brief, not a literal blueprint. Create a photorealistic rendering of what the final manufactured product would actually look like.

DESIGN INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES:

Geometry & Proportions:
- Preserve core functional elements and overall form language from the drawing
- Refine proportions for visual balance and ergonomics (patent drawings often have exaggerated or clunky dimensions)
- Smooth transitions between surfaces; eliminate technical drawing artifacts
- Optimize curves and radii for manufacturing and aesthetics

Materials & Finish:
- Infer appropriate premium materials based on product category and era suggested by patent date
- Apply realistic surface treatments: brushed aluminum, polished glass, matte plastics, etc.
- Consider what materials would actually be used in production (not just what the drawing shows)
- Add subtle material variations (anodization, texturing, glossy vs matte regions)

Manufacturing Details:
- Add production-realistic elements: button travel, screen bezels, seam lines, ventilation patterns
- Include subtle details like chamfered edges, press-fit indicators, tactile grip areas
- Remove reference numbers and dimension lines entirely
- Refine any mechanical elements (click wheels, ports, speakers) to production quality

Product Photography Style:
- Professional studio lighting (key + fill + rim light setup)
- Neutral gradient background (white to light gray)
- Shallow depth of field emphasizing hero features
- Subtle reflections showing material quality
- 3/4 perspective angle showing primary interaction surfaces

CREATIVE FREEDOM:
- If multiple design interpretations are plausible, choose the most elegant/commercially viable option
- Apply contemporary industrial design principles appropriate to the product category
- Make decisions on color, finish, and details that weren't specified in the patent
- Think "what would this look like in a product launch keynote?" not "technical documentation"

AVOID: 
- Literal recreation of patent linework
- Reference numbers or technical annotations
- Overly futuristic or concept-car styling (stay grounded)
- Cheap-looking materials or unrefined details
