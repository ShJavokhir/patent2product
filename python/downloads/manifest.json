    "title": "Tactile feedback glove",
    "abstract": "A tactile feedback glove for use in an extravehicular activity (EVA) environment by an astronaut is described. The tactile feedback glove is formed by a glove having an outer layer, a second layer and inner bladder, wherein the inner bladder encloses a gas environment suitable for an astronaut's hand. A force sensor is attached to a fingertip of each finger of the glove on an inner surface of the outer layer to sense the pressure applied at the associated fingertip. A haptic feedback device is attached to the fingertip of each finger of the glove on an outer surface of the inner bladder. Each haptic feedback device is adjacent to each associated force sensor and positioned to provide tactile feedback for the associated finger. A visual feedback device is also attached to an outer surface of the outer layer of the glove in a visual field of the astronaut. A controller receives a signal from each force sensor indicative of the force applied by the wearer at the associated fingertip, and sends a feedback signal to drive each haptic feedback device and the visual feedback device to provide tactile and visual feedback to the wearer when the signal from one of the force sensors meets preprogrammed levels.",

    "title": "Systems and methods for functionality and controls for a VTOL flying car",
    "abstract": "A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft has a first drivable configuration in which the pilot seat is positioned between the wings and facing the direction of forward travel. The VTOL may be driven in the first configuration as a normal automobile. In the first configuration the wings are aligned with the direction of forward travel and their surfaces are vertically oriented. In the first configuration, the VTOL may also attain altitude and be maneuvered using thrust from propulsion sources. In a second configuration, the pilot seat is rotated 90 degrees from the direction of forward travel to a direction of forward flight. Forward flight is achieved using thrust to rotate the wings from the vertical orientation to a lift-providing orientation. In concert with the rotation of the wings, the pi lot seat is counter-rotated to maintain the seat facing the direction of forward flight.",
